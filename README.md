# Unit 2 Section 6 Exercise 2
This example project is written in Python, and tested with pytest.

### The assignment
Create a function that takes in a number, then prints a triangle of * with that number of rows:

### Input
5

### Output
*  
**  
***  
****  
*****  

### Notes
- pip's install path is not included in the PATH var by default, so without installing via `sudo -H`, pytest would be unaccessible.
